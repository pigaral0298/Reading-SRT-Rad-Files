# Reading-SRT-Rad-Files

This is a script and Jupyter Notebook that will help read the .rad files generated by the SRT for the Astronomy 460 class at UW-Madison. 
The script is set-up to work with observing mode 4 spectra files but a few variables can be changed to be able to use different observing modes.
Part of the user inputs for this code asks for a "mode" input. Input of 0 keeps all the spectra in the code itself in the "spectra" variable which is a list of lists which are the individual spectra. Using mode 1 will ask for an output destination folder to write all the spectra to. Those files are .dat files and can be read as a standard text file with each line with the format: frequency intensity. 
One final quick note: The code does not currently support files which do not have a noise calibration in them. It can be modified to work with that functionality but for now it only works and outputs the spectra if the noisecal is done. A potential workaround would be to remove that condition from the final if statement in the final part of the main loop but a more formal fix will be implemented eventually.
The Jupyter Notebook is likely the easiest way to interact with the script but it can be used in a script mode as well.
